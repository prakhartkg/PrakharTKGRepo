1.    Consider the following class,
Class YashEmploy{
     Integer id;
     String name;
     Integer age;
     Double salary;
    
     //getters() & setters;
}
a)    Write a simple program which stores 10 YashEmploy objects in ArrayList and iterate it.
b)    Write a program that sort the list of 10 YashEmploy objects(Natural Sorting) using comparable.
c)     Write a program that sort the list of 10 YashEmploys using comparator for the following two cases :
i)                   Consider that CEO wants to sort the employees based on their salaries.
